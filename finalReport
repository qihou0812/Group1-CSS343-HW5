1. Brief analysis
Genetic algorithm is a non-deterministic algorithm. The algorithm is random and can
only find the solution with a certain probability. Therefore, sometimes it is unreliable.
When the puzzle is easy, the algorithm easily finds the solution. It may take several
hundred generations. If the puzzle is hard, it’s hard to find the solution. Although I make
the algorithm iterates for 10k generations, it doesn’t still find the solution.
In some time, GA can not find the solution, and it only find the best solution in some
extent. For some puzzle, one running of the algorithm can find the solution, but another
running may not find the solution.
2. Build and Run
Build:
g++ -std=c++11 -o solver *.cpp
Run:
./solver 300 1000
First number is the size of the population. Second number is the maximum number of
generations.
