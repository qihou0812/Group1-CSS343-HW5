This project is for reading arguments from users for input of a sodoku board. 
Each board contains 9 rows, 9 collumns and 9 of 3 x3 squares.
Firstly, check if the input is a valid board. A valid board is each number (from 1-9) appears
once in each row, each collumn and each 3 x 3 square. 
After the input is validated, generate possible solutions and print one solution out.
If there's no solution, the solution that has least error will be chosen.
